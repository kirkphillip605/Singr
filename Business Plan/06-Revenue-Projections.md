| Scenario      | Active Subscriptions |
|---------------|----------------------|

| Moderate       | 500                  |
| Growth         | 1500                 |

## Detailed Revenue Breakdown

### Conservative Scenario (250 Active Subscriptions)
1. **Subscription Revenue Breakdown**
   - Monthly (40%): 100 subscriptions
   - Semi-Annual (30%): 75 subscriptions
   - Annual (30%): 75 subscriptions

2. **Revenue Calculations**
   - Monthly Plan: $10
   - Semi-Annual Plan: $55
   - Annual Plan: $200
   - Subscription Revenue: 
     - Monthly: 100 * $10 * 12 = $12,000
     - Semi-Annual: 75 * $55 = $4,125 (per year)
     - Annual: 75 * $200 = $15,000 (per year)

3. **Software Licensing Revenue**
   - Annual Subscribers: 75 * 60% = 45
   - Revenue from New Sales: 45 * $300 = $13,500 (first year)
   - Revenue from Renewals: 18 (40% renewal rate) * $300 = $5,400 (second year)

4. **Total Revenue Calculation**
   - Year 1: $12,000 + $4,125 + $15,000 + $13,500 = $44,625
   - Year 2: $12,000 + $4,125 + $15,000 + $5,400 = $36,525
   - Year 3: (Assuming 20% growth) $36,525 * 1.2 = $43,830
